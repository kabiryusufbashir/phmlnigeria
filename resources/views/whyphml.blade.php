                            No other HMO truly understands how demanding the job of the Police officer is, like we do.  Therefore, the Police Health Maintenance Limited is committed to ensuring that all eligible Police personnel and their immediate family members, receive excellent healthcare.

                            We achieve this by interfacing between our enrolees and the over 2,000 NHIS accredited healthcare providers in our network, spread across the four corners of Nigeria.
